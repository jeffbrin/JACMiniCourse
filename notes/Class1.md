# Class 1
## Goal ðŸ¥… : 
    Create a Canvas on a Website and get input from the keyboard

## What is code?
    A list of instructions interpreted by a computer

    Code is read from top (line 1) to bottom

    Not all code is read if not used
        For example functions will not be interpreted if not called
    Programing Languages
        JavaScript
            Used for most websites due to 'ease of use'
            Can be run directly in the browser
            It is an interpreted language
        C#
            Language used mostly by Microsoft, it is a very powerful
            compiled language.
        Python
            Interpreted and Compiled
            Used for scripting, automation, etc.

    Interpreted Vs. Compiled
        Interpreted languages don't have to 'build' they will run until there is an error.

        Compiled languages MUST be 'built'. 
        The compiler goes through the code line by line and will give errors before even being able to run the program.
        They will not let you use a variable that wasn't declared


## How is code run in the browser
    HTML is the content.
    JavaScript is the logic and interactivity.
    (Demonstrate running something in the browser).

## Code Example
    let i = 5;
    let b = 4;

    i = 6;
    b = i;

    console.log(b);


## Variables
### Variables have types (in JS)
    
        Number
        String
        Boolean
        Array
        Objects

    Variable is a box you assign a value to
    
    JS Nonsense:
        Weakly Typed
        Type coercion
    console stuff showing data types
    
    Naming Conventions
    
    
## Syntax

    Operators
        (+) Addition
        (-) Subtracting
        (/) Division
        (%) Modulo
        (*) Multiplication

    Equality Operators
        (==) or (===) Means equality testing
            1 == 2 -> evaluates to false
        (!=) Means not equal
            1 != 2 -> evaluates to true
        (>) Greater than
            1 > 2 -> evaluates to false
        (<) Less than
            1 < 2 -> evaluates to true
        (>=) Greater than OR equals
            2 >= 2 -> evaluates to true
        (<=) Less than OR equals
            2 <= 2 -> evaluates to true

    

## If Statements
    Goes into code block (Braces) if the statement is TRUE
    if(true){
        //go Here
    }
    else{
        //go here if false
    }



    else if()

## Code Examples
    let isSunny = true;

    if(isSunny){
        console.log("Go Outside");
    }
    else{
        console.log("Movie Night!");
    }

## Functions (Brief)
    Code Block
    Can pass in arguments

    function addTwoNumbers(first, second){
        return first + second;
    }

## Syntax
        Semicolon (;) means the end of line 

        Equals Sign(=) means assigning something to a variable

        Quotes(" ") Denotes a string notation

        Period (.) Using on an object in order to access something within the object

        Braces { } Denotes a 'block' of code

        Brackets ( ) Used for If statements and functions

        Square Brackets [ ] Used with arrays in order to access something within the array
